# Valkey status conditions

The `ValkeyCluster` and `ValkeyNode` custom resources use their `status` fields to provide detailed feedback about the current state of the Valkey cluster and its managed nodes. This document explains the different fields and conditions you can use to monitor and understand cluster and node health.

## Status fields

These top-level fields in `.status` provide a high-level, human-readable summary of the cluster's state.

- **`state`**: A single word that summarizes the overall condition of the cluster. The possible values are:
  - `Initializing`: The cluster is being created for the first time.
  - `Reconciling`: The operator is actively working to bring the cluster to its desired state (e.g., scaling, updating, or recovering).
  - `Ready`: The cluster is healthy, fully functional, and serving traffic.
  - `Degraded`: The cluster is at least partially functional but is in an unhealthy state (e.g., a primary is down, not all replicas are available).
  - `Failed`: The operator has encountered a persistent error and cannot reach the desired state.

- **`reason`**: A machine-readable, `CamelCase` string that provides a brief explanation for the current `state`.

- **`message`**: A detailed, human-readable message explaining the current state.

- **`shards`**: The number of shards currently detected in the Valkey cluster.

- **`readyShards`**: The number of shards that are fully healthy, meaning they have a primary and the desired number of replicas.

---

## Conditions array (`status.conditions[]`)

`conditions[]` follows the standard Kubernetes `metav1.Condition` format:

- **type**: condition name (e.g., `Ready`, `Progressing`)
- **status**: `True`, `False`, or `Unknown`
- **reason**: short machine-readable code (stable)
- **message**: human-readable explanation
- **lastTransitionTime**: time when the condition last changed
- **observedGeneration**: the resource generation the controller observed when setting the condition

---

## Condition types

### Standard conditions

#### `Ready`
Indicates whether the cluster is fully functional and serving traffic.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | All shards exist with correct number of nodes, **cluster is healthy**, and topology is complete. |
| `False` | Initial creation, topology changes needed, missing shards/replicas, or infrastructure errors. |

Common reasons when `Ready=False`:
- `ServiceError` – failed to create/update headless service
- `ConfigMapError` – failed to create/update configuration
- `UsersACLError` – failed to reconcile ACL users/secrets
- `SystemUsersACLError` – failed to reconcile system/internal ACL users
- `ValkeyNodeError` – failed to create/update ValkeyNode CRs
- `ValkeyNodeListError` – failed to list ValkeyNodes
- `PodDisruptionBudgetError` – failed to create/update/delete the PodDisruptionBudget
- `Reconciling` – controller is making changes
- `UpdatingNodes` – rolling update of ValkeyNode CRs in progress
- `MissingShards` – waiting for all shards to be created
- `MissingReplicas` – waiting for all replicas to be created
- `PodUnschedulable` – Kubernetes cannot schedule one or more Valkey pods

Common reasons when `Ready=True`:
- `ClusterHealthy` – Cluster is healthy

#### `Progressing`
Indicates whether the cluster is being created, updated, or scaled.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | Reconciliation in progress (creating resources, adding nodes, etc.). |
| `False` | Cluster matches desired state and is stable. |

Common reasons:
- `Initializing` – initial cluster creation
- `Reconciling` – general reconciliation in progress
- `AddingNodes` – adding nodes to the cluster
- `UpdatingNodes` – rolling update of ValkeyNode CRs in progress
- `RebalancingSlots` – rebalancing hash slots across primaries (scale-out and scale-in)
- `ReconcileComplete` – reconciliation finished (typically with `status=False`)

#### `Degraded`
Indicates whether the cluster is impaired but may still be partially functional.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | Cluster has issues but may still serve traffic. |
| `False` (or absent) | Cluster is not degraded. |

Common reasons:
- `NodeAddFailed` – failed to add a node to the cluster
- `RebalanceFailed` – slot rebalancing failed (scale-out or scale-in)
- `PodUnschedulable` – Kubernetes scheduler cannot place one or more Valkey pods, for example because strict topology spread constraints cannot be satisfied

---

### Valkey-specific conditions

#### `ClusterFormed`
Indicates whether all nodes have joined the cluster and meet the desired shard/replica layout.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | All shards and replicas are present and joined. |
| `False` | Pending nodes, missing shards, or missing replicas. |

Typical reasons:
- `ClusterFormed` – Cluster is formed
- `MissingShards` – waiting for shards
- `MissingReplicas` – waiting for replicas

#### `SlotsAssigned`
Indicates whether all **16384** hash slots are assigned to primaries.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | All slots are assigned. |
| `False` (or absent) | Some slots remain unassigned. |

Common reasons:
- `AllSlotsAssigned` – all 16384 slots are assigned
- `SlotsUnassigned` – waiting for slots to be assigned

---

### ValkeyNode conditions

`ValkeyNode` resources are internal resources created by the operator for each Valkey cluster member. Their conditions are useful when debugging why a cluster is still reconciling, especially when persistence is enabled.

#### `Ready`
Indicates whether the ValkeyNode pod is ready and the backing workload has completed rollout.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | The pod is running, ready, and the workload is rolled out to the current spec. |
| `False` | The pod is missing, not ready, rolling out, or blocked by an infrastructure dependency such as a PVC. |

Common reasons when `Ready=False`:
- `PodNotReady` – pod is missing, not ready, or the workload has not finished rolling out.
- `PersistentVolumeClaimPending` – persistence is enabled and the managed PVC is missing or not yet bound.

Common reasons when `Ready=True`:
- `PodRunning` – pod is running, ready, and the workload is rolled out.

#### `PersistentVolumeClaimReady`
Indicates whether the managed PVC for a persistent ValkeyNode exists and is bound.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | The managed PVC is `Bound` and can be mounted by the pod. |
| `False` | The managed PVC does not exist yet or is not bound. |

Common reasons:
- `PersistentVolumeClaimPending` – PVC is missing or still pending.
- `PersistentVolumeClaimBound` – PVC is bound.

#### `PersistentVolumeClaimSizeReady`
Indicates whether the managed PVC has satisfied the requested storage size.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | The PVC capacity is at least the requested `spec.persistence.size`. |
| `False` | The PVC is not bound, expansion is still running, expansion is pending, or expansion cannot be satisfied. |

Common reasons:
- `PersistentVolumeClaimSizeSatisfied` – PVC capacity satisfies the requested size.
- `PersistentVolumeClaimResizePending` – PVC is waiting for binding, controller expansion, or node-side filesystem resize.
- `PersistentVolumeClaimResizeInProgress` – PVC expansion is actively in progress.
- `PersistentVolumeClaimResizeInfeasible` – PVC expansion failed or cannot be completed without operator action.

#### `LiveConfigApplied`
Indicates whether the live-settable subset of `spec.config` has been successfully applied to the running Valkey process via `CONFIG SET`.

This condition is only set when the node is ready and there are allowlisted config keys present in `spec.config`. If `spec.config` contains no allowlisted keys the condition is absent, which is treated the same as `True` by the cluster controller.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | All allowlisted config keys were applied successfully in the last reconcile. |
| `False` | `CONFIG SET` failed; the running config may not match `spec.config`. The cluster controller will not advance past this node until the condition is `True`. |

Common reasons when `LiveConfigApplied=False`:
- `ApplyFailed` – `CONFIG SET` returned an error (e.g. a permissions error or an invalid value). The message field contains the exact error.

Common reasons when `LiveConfigApplied=True`:
- `Applied` – Live config applied successfully.

> **Note:** A `False` condition blocks one-at-a-time progress in the cluster controller (the same way `Ready=False` does during a rolling update). The node controller retries with exponential backoff and emits a `LiveConfigApplyFailed` warning event on each failure. The condition clears in either of two ways: once `CONFIG SET` succeeds it transitions to `True`, or if the offending key is removed from `spec.config` (leaving no allowlisted keys) the condition is removed and reverts to absent. Either way the cluster advances.

Example commands:

```bash
# View internal nodes and their readiness
kubectl get valkeynodes

# Inspect PVC-related conditions for a node
kubectl get valkeynode my-cluster-0-0 -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="PersistentVolumeClaimReady")]}'
kubectl get valkeynode my-cluster-0-0 -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="PersistentVolumeClaimSizeReady")]}'
```

## State transitions

The high-level `state` is derived from conditions (priority order):

1. `Degraded=True` → `state=Degraded`
2. `Ready=True` → `state=Ready`
3. `Progressing=True` → `state=Reconciling`
4. `Ready=False` with no other stronger signal → `state=Failed`

> **Note:** `Initializing` is the CRD default for `status.state` and is visible briefly on a brand-new cluster before the controller first updates the status to `Reconciling`.

### Visual flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Initializing: CRD default (before first reconcile)

## Kubernetes Events

Events complement the status conditions described above. While `conditions` represent the current state of the cluster (e.g., `Ready=True`), events provide a historical timeline of actions and changes (e.g., "Created deployment 1 of 6"). Use conditions for monitoring the current state and events for understanding what happened and troubleshooting issues.

### How to read it

- **Summary**
  - `State: Ready` + `Reason: ClusterHealthy` + `Message: Cluster is healthy` → cluster is serving normally.
  - `Shards: 3` and `Ready Shards: 3` → all shards are formed and healthy.

- **Conditions**
  - `Progressing=False (ReconcileComplete)` → controller is not actively changing anything.
  - `Ready=True (ClusterHealthy)` → cluster is fully functional.
  - `ClusterFormed=True (TopologyComplete)` → nodes have joined and match the requested topology (`spec.shards=3`, `spec.replicas=1`).
  - `SlotsAssigned=True (AllSlotsAssigned)` → all 16384 hash slots are assigned.

- **Observed Generation**
  - `Observed Generation: 1` on all conditions means status reflects **Generation 1** of the spec (i.e., the latest desired configuration at the time).

- **Events**
  - Events show the historical timeline of what the operator did to reach the current state.
  - All events are `Normal` type, indicating successful operations.
  - Events are retained for ~1 hour by default (configurable in Kubernetes).
  - Events are rate-limited by Kubernetes to prevent flooding (e.g., identical events are aggregated).

After a spec update (e.g. image upgrade), the rolling update path produces:

```text
k get valkeycluster -A -o wide -w
NAMESPACE   NAME                   STATE          REASON           READYSHARDS   AGE
default     valkeycluster-sample   Reconciling    UpdatingNodes    3             5m
default     valkeycluster-sample   Reconciling    UpdatingNodes    3             5m
default     valkeycluster-sample   Ready          ClusterHealthy   3             6m
```

### What this indicates

- **Initializing → Reconciling**
  - `Initializing` is the **initial state** for a new cluster before reconciliation begins.
  - Transition to `Reconciling` means reconciliation has begun.

- **Reconciling (AddingNodes)**
  - `Reason=AddingNodes` indicates the controller is actively joining pods to the Valkey cluster.
  - `READYSHARDS` increases (0 → 1 → 2 → 3) as shards become fully healthy.

- **Reconciling (UpdatingNodes)**
  - `Reason=UpdatingNodes` indicates a rolling update of ValkeyNode CRs is in progress (one node at a time, replicas before primaries).

- **Ready (ClusterHealthy)**
  - Once `READYSHARDS` reaches the desired shard count and the cluster is healthy, the summary switches to `Ready / ClusterHealthy`.
