# Developer guide

## Contributing

Any changes to the CRD API (`src/api.rs` and `config/crd/bases/`) must be agreed with the core team before implementation.

## Development commands

```sh
make test          # Run unit/integration tests (no cluster needed)
make lint          # Run clippy with warnings denied
make lint-fix      # Run clippy with auto-fix
make fmt           # Run cargo fmt
make fmt-check     # Check cargo fmt output
make check         # Type-check all Rust targets
make build         # Build the manager binary
make manifests     # Validate checked-in CRD manifests with kustomize
```

After modifying types in `src/api.rs`, update `config/crd/bases/` intentionally and run `make manifests` before testing.

Run all library tests:

```sh
cargo test --lib
```

Run tests matching a module or test name:

```sh
cargo test valkey::tests::plan_rebalance
```

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain.
- Docker or Podman.
- kubectl v1.31+.
- kustomize, or kubectl with built-in `kubectl kustomize`, for manifest validation.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.31+ cluster.

## Build and deploy from source

**Build and push the operator image:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/valkey-operator:tag
```

## Publish images with GitHub Actions

The `Publish` GitHub Actions workflow builds multi-architecture images and publishes them to GitHub Container Registry:

```text
ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>
```

It runs on pushes to `main`, `v*` tags, and manual `workflow_dispatch` runs. Pull requests build the image without pushing it.

Published tags include:

* `latest` for the default branch
* the branch name for branch pushes
* semver tags for `v*` releases, such as `1.2.3`, `1.2`, `v1.2.3`, and `v1.2`
* the short commit SHA

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the operator to the cluster:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/valkey-operator:tag
```

**Create a sample ValkeyCluster:**

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/v1alpha1_valkeycluster.yaml
```

## Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -f config/samples/v1alpha1_valkeycluster.yaml
```

**Delete the CRDs from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**Undeploy the controller from the cluster:**

> **⚠️ Warning:** `make undeploy` removes all resources in the operator's namespace. Always deploy the operator in a dedicated namespace to avoid accidentally deleting unrelated workloads.

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Build the install bundle

Generate a single YAML file containing all resources (CRDs, RBAC, deployment):

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/valkey-operator:tag
```

This produces `dist/install.yaml` which can be applied with `kubectl apply -f`.

## Run the operator locally

`make run` starts the Rust manager locally against the Kubernetes cluster selected by your kubeconfig.
Since neither Pod IPs are routable, nor Pod FQDNs are resolvable outside the cluster, any attempt by the operator to connect to a Valkey pod will fail.

Here is a procedure to make it work, but you might need to adapt depending on your setup.

### Prerequisites

* Linux and a distro using `systemd-resolved` for DNS (like Ubuntu >= 22.04, Fedora >= 36).
* K8s cluster via `minikube`, with the [Docker driver](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/) (default on Linux).
* The domain name for your cluster is `cluster.local`.

### Steps

#### 1. Start the K8s cluster and install the operator CRD.

```bash
minikube start
make install
```

#### 2. Setup local access to the services in the minikube cluster.

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

This creates a network route on the host for the service CIDR using the minikube IP address as a gateway.
We will be able to connect to services locally.
See `ip route` showing `10.96.0.0/12 via 192.168.49.2 dev br-ea36a389b2f9`.

#### 3. Setup local access to the pods in the minikube cluster.

```bash
for name cidr in $(kubectl get nodes -Ao jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{@.metadata.name}{" "}{@.spec.podCIDR}{"\n"}{end}'); do echo sudo ip route add $cidr via $(minikube ip -n $name); done
```

This adds a similar route as in the previous step, but for Pod CIDR ranges.
We get the podCIDR range for each node using kubectl, then route the range to the node IP.

Now the operator running outside the K8s cluster should be able to connect to a listener using the Pod IP.
Since we probably also want to access it using FQDN, like when accessing a pod in a headless service using
`<pod-name>.<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`, we also need to setup the DNS.


#### 4. Setup DNS to be able to resolve `cluster.local` domain names.

```bash
# Add kube-dns to the list of DNS servers
sudo resolvectl dns $(ip route | grep $(minikube ip) | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq) $(kubectl -n kube-system get svc kube-dns -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')

# Forward request for cluster.local to the kube-dns
sudo resolvectl domain $(ip route | grep $(minikube ip) | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq) cluster.local

# Test
# Optionally run `resolvectl` to check the status.
dig kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Since we want the `kube-dns` in the cluster to resolve all queries ending with `cluster.local` we need to
configure our local DNS service to forward these request.
We first need to get the network bridge towards minikube, using `ip route | grep $(minikube ip) | awk '{print $NF}'`,
then we also need the ServiceIP for the `kube-dns` service in the K8s cluster,
we get this using `kubectl -n kube-system get svc kube-dns -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'`.
With this information we can configure the local DNS service using `resolvectl`.

#### 5. Start the operator locally and create a CR to trigger the reconciler.

```bash
make run
kubectl create -f config/samples/v1alpha1_valkeycluster.yaml
```

The operator should now be able to connect to Valkey containers in the minikube cluster.
